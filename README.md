# About the Dataset
1. DateTime (hourly): date and time when the data was recorded
2. Temp_Box: Environment Temperature
3. Temp_[hive_no]: Hive Core Temperature
4. Temp_Easy_[hive_no]: Hive's Peripheral Temperature (different than Temp_Box when ice is applied on top)
5. Hum_Box: Environment Humidity
6. Hum_[hive_no]: Hive Core Humidity
7. Hum_Easy_[hive_no]: Hive's Peripheral Humidity
8. Treatment: 0 = no ice; 1 = ice applied
